# Pure
## My custom fork
**This is my custom fork of https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure. For information about this project, see that project, since this is the exact same (with a couple minor modifications).**

#### Modifications
This repo has been modified from https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure in the following ways.

 - The username and hostname in the prompt are always visible.
 - If `$SHLVL` is greater than `1`, it is shown in brackets (in `magenta`) before the username.
 - If the session is inside SSH or a container, `(ssh)` or `(container)` is shown (in `cyan`) at the beginning of the prompt.
